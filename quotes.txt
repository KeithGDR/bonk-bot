Yeah, that's right!
You're gettin' dominated, chucklehead!
Domination'. Look it up.
You're like a car crash in slow motion. It's like I'm watchin' ya fly through a windshield.
Hit the bricks, pal. You're done.
Ha ha! Look at you! You look like you ran through traffic!
Hey knucklehead, you ain't gonna win.
Oh what, you gonna cry? You gonna cry now?
Yeah, I dare ya, rage quit. C'mon, make us both happy!

This map ain't big enough for the two of us.
Hit the road, bozo! Let a real Scout get to work!
You're like a car crash in slow motion. It's like I'm watchin' ya fly through a windshield.
Yo, I'm not even wearin' a helmet!
What is your major malfunction, brother?
Drop dead and gimme 20!
You're a disgrace to the uniform, pal!
Dis-missed!
There ain't enough crits in the world to kill me!
It's startin' to bore me how much you suck.
Hey, who's on fire now?
Yo, if you didn't want me to kill ya, ya shoulda said somethin'!
Repeat after me: mhmm-mhmm-mhmm I'm dead!'

Dude, you'd get a closed casket at the ugly cemetery.
You just got freakin' dominated, knucklehead, all right let's do this!
I don't usually kill morons this fast.

Blow that up, cyclops!
The best man won, ya bomb-throwin' drunk!
Your clock just got cleaned, rummy!
Depth perception, pal. Look into it.
Drink it in, pal. That's how failure tastes.
Would you look at you? I mean, look at you.
I am owning you, you fat, bald bastard!
Today ain't yer day, pancakes!
$400,000 to fire that gun, huh? Yeah, money well spent!
Them $200 bullets ain't so hot when they don't hit nuthin', are they?

You'll never hit me! You'll never hit my tiny head! It's so tiny I got a frickin'... such a tiny li'l head!
I'll put it in my trophy room, with the othas.

Dominated, ya shapeshiftin' rat!
Hard to stab a guy in the back when he's beatin' your frickin' head in, huh?
Hehey, look, you shapeshifted into a dead guy!
Man, your skull's so soft you're makin' this easy!
Pop quiz: How long's it take to beat a moron to death? bzzzz Sorry, time's up, you're dead.

Let's win already! I don't got time for dis! I've got a date! A real one! Don't look into it.
Here's the plan, Bat. I'll run around fast, being da best and you be in my hand and bash heads! Got it?
I'm so fast I got my feet insured...with a bank! Well, it's just a guy who works in a store next door to a bank. Well, let's go!
I'm so fast I got my feet bronzed! And now I'm not as fast.

Am I flankin'?
We shoulda discussed this beforehand! Am I flankin'?
I'll see you slowpokes at Mid!
Last one to Mid is not me!
Party at Mid when we take da point!
Look up 'utility' in da dictionary. Know what it means? Means you can do freakin' everything!
We ain't scrimmin' here!
What, you think that this is a scrim? I got news for you, it's not!
Yeah! Comp stuff!
Man, I saw those guys in the way in. This does not seem competitive!
I spec'd these guys earlier. They looked terrible.
I spec'd these guys earlier. They were all over the place. Frankly, I'm not impressed.
Just a scrim. Just a scrim! No biggie!
I spec'd these guys earlier. They look ugly. I didn't want to say it, but they do. Their hats are terrible, their faces aren't very good or attractive...
It's just a scrim, no big deal! Nobody's countin' points. We're just, we're just foolin' around here! Gettin' a little goofy...
Are you guys ready to scrim? I'm ready to scrim! This is, this is just a scrim, right?
Ok Bat, it's all on us now. Technically, there's five other guys, but I can't hit people on the head with them. So, it's you and me Bashy.
Yeah, hah hah! 6s stuff!
Just six guys alone in the desert tryin' to kill each other. Happens all the time. I don't know where you grew up, but dis is pretty normal around here. In the desert.
Dey got six of dem ding-dongs over there, huh.
Looks like six more notches for my lucky skull-bat!
Go team, everybody! Six trained killers, am I right? Best of da best! And best friends. We don't say it a lot, or at all, but we're all feelin' it here. In our hearts, you know? The frien-the friendship.
I am in da zone!
Yeah, we're doing pretty good!
I love winnin'! Love it!
Yeah, dis is how winners run!
Wanna see a winner run a circle around you!
We are gonna own this!
Man, it is unfair how good I am!
There is no way we're gonna lose now!
We're on a winnin' streak!
We're runnin' circles around those guys!
Guys, I'm right here! Of course, we're gonna win!
Watch a winner in action, pal! Wup, too fast. Just a blur. Maybe next time.
Spoilers: but, uh, we're gonna win this.
Hey! Other team! See dis butt! Eat it! Eat my butt! Ha ha ha! Yeah!
Hey! Other team! We all got together and we got you a little somethin'. It's an ass-beatin'! We're gonna come over there and give it to you right now!
I have this disorder that makes it physically impossible for me to lose! It also makes me irresistible to ladies. Like all ladies. Everywhere.
Hey! Hey, other team! How'd that taste! Like crap? Yeah, 'cause I fed you crap!
Hey! Hey, other team! Time out! I got something real important to tell you! You suck! Ha ha ha! Yeah, yeah take that, other team!
At this rate, they're gonna need way more than six guys!
What do they got? Six guys? Eh, that's not enough.
Man, losing is stupid!
Nobody saw us lose that one, right?
Last one didn't count! Just a warmup!
Alright, we tried losin', and it sucks. Let's go back to winnin'!
Come from behind victory! Cinderella story, startin' now!
Come on guys, we're the underdogs here! Let's get this done!
Ok, they got lucky once! Nobody gets lucky twice, though. It's impossible.
We're turning this ship around! The SS We're Done Sucking is about to launch! Dis is your captain speaking! Buckle your seatbelts 'cause this boat is going like freakin' Mach 12!
Guys, don't make me win this myself! Let's all try this time! Do it for Scout!
Ok guys, bad news: we lost that last one. Good news: you still got me.
Ties are stupid!
Ties are da worst!
Let's break this tie already
Oh I am done being tied!
Let's get to winnin' already!
Ah, I hate ties! Let's break it already!
We are gonna break this thing, now!
Yea-ah!

Oh man, we're da best!
And...that's a match!
We took da match, guys!
Wuh hoo hoo hoo! Dat's a match!
Just winnin' another match. No big whoop.
I don't know how to lose. I tried it once. It didn't work.
Dat is how you win a match!
Yeah dat's right!
Dat is how you do it!
Not too shabby!
We make it look easy!
Yeah, boom! Dat's right!
I could get used to dis!
Hey, I was just gettin' started!
Dat is how you win a game!
Dat's how you win, pal!
Yeah, we're pretty great!

Come on, push! Unicorn power!
My pony magic does nothing!
Unicorn on fire! Unicorn on fire!
I am a horned nightmare!
I am an invincible unicorn!
Are you even tryin'?
Yo, did ya even see me hittin' ya?
